# Pairs-trading
This was our algorithms for the Midwest Trading Competition at the University of Chicago. The competition had two cases:
1) Pairs Trading (S&P500 Mini Futures and Treasury Bonds)
2) Options Market Making (S&P500 and Treasury Bonds)

The competition used Trading Technology's patent technology that had coded blocks in it. However, some amount of work had to be done in Python. 
Our algorithms finished first in one round of the first case, and finished eighth overall. We hedged Treasury Notes against S&P to minimize our risk and traded the spread.
